# Word Rectangle

"Uh……… what is this?" I hear you ask.  Great question.

A word rectangle is a rectangle of letters which comprise words when read horizontally or vertically.  Behold:

```
G L A S S E S
R E L A P S E
I M I T A T E
S M E A R E D
T A N N E R Y
```

This is a brute-force solution to this problem.  It runs on a Raspberry Pi on my desk.

You can read more about the word rectangle and its history [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square).

This is version two; version one is [here](https://github.com/tjwds/word_rectangle).  This version reduces the amount of work for each iteration and also has some tests.
